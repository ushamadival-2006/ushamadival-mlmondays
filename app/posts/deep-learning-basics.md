Deep learning has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, powering everything from voice assistants to autonomous vehicles. This revolutionary approach to artificial intelligence draws inspiration from the most complex system we know: the human brain.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the fundamentals of deep learning and discover how artificial neural networks are changing the world.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses **artificial neural networks with multiple layers** to model complex patterns in data.

Key points:

- Inspired by the human brain  
- Automatically learns features from raw data  
- Excels in unstructured data (images, audio, text)  

Unlike traditional ML models requiring manual feature engineering, deep learning systems learn patterns automatically.

## The Foundation: Neural Networks

Neural networks are the core building blocks of deep learning systems.

### How Neural Networks Work

A neural network includes:

- **Input Layer** — Receives data  
- **Hidden Layers** — Process information  
- **Output Layer** — Produces the final result  

Training involves:

1. Receiving input  
2. Processing through layers  
3. Predicting output  
4. Comparing with true labels  
5. Adjusting weights  
6. Repeating thousands of times  

Once trained, networks can make accurate predictions on unseen data.
